# RLox

After finishing my implementation of Lox in _Crafting Interpreters_ [here](github.com/jakestambaugh/craftinginterpreters) I want to try it in Rust! Very much in-progress.

## Running the test suite

```
dart --snapshot=build/test.dart.snapshot --snapshot-kind=app-jit tool/bin/test.dart rlox
```
